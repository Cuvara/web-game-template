// Neon Drift Arena, played in a browser against the built bundle.

// GOLDEN-RUN REPLAY. Ported from examples/neon-drift-arena/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts by the
// Factory's golden-run replay developer; not agent-written. Each test carries @aspect tags
// the verify step maps to gameplay aspects. Requests to anything but the preview server are
// aborted, so a portal SDK script is never fetched: the game must cope without it, and the
// suite never touches the network. It never reads pixels: the deterministic probe exposes
// score, state and the pure-sim hooks, so play is scripted and asserted exactly.
