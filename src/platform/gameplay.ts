// Gameplay integration: where the game's own moments meet the platform abstraction.
//
// Template-owned since contract 2 (ported from the Factory's scripts/wgf_sdk/game/src/
// platform/gameplay.ts). main.ts boots through `bootPlatform` and installs one
// `PlatformGameplay` before the game is created, so the Factory's `sdk` step no longer
// patches main.ts: it regenerates ./integration-plan.ts (data) and nothing else. Game code
// calls the hooks here — a run started, the player died, a level ended, the game saved — and
// this file decides what each moment means on the platform the build is running on, using
// only the `Platform` interface from @wgf/platform-sdk. It never touches a portal SDK, and it
// never assumes a capability: every ad is asked for through the capability list (and
// `adAvailability`, where the SDK has it) first, and every failure resolves to "carry on
// without it".
//
// What each moment does is data, in ./integration-plan.ts, generated from the title's
// game-design placements. Change the design and re-run the step; do not hand-edit the plan.
//
// Portal rules this file carries, each from the portal's own documentation:
//   - gameplay stop on every interruption, start when the player is back in control
//     (Yandex 1.19.3, CrazyGames gameplayStart/Stop, Poki requirements)
//   - audio muted and gameplay paused while an ad plays (Yandex 4.7, CrazyGames adStarted,
//     Poki "mute game audio during advertisement playback")
//   - the portal's own pause (Yandex game_api_pause: launch ad, purchase window) pauses and
//     mutes the game (Yandex 1.19.4)
//   - a reward only on the portal's confirmation (all three)
//   - no rewarded button that cannot work (CrazyGames ads requirements, Poki requirements)
//   - Poki: a commercial break each time the player heads back into gameplay, and no local
//     ad timer ("signal as many opportunities as possible"); driven by `breakOnContinue`
